# 🧠 CogniPlay

### AI-Powered Cognitive Development Platform for Early Learners

---

## 🚀 Overview

CogniPlay is a gamified mobile application designed to assess and improve cognitive skills in young children through interactive tasks and AI-driven insights.

Instead of relying solely on traditional IQ tests, CogniPlay evaluates children based on real-time performance in engaging games, providing a more holistic understanding of their learning abilities.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Early childhood assessments are often:

* Rigid and standardized
* Not adaptive to individual learning pace
* Focused on IQ rather than practical cognitive skills

This can lead to:

* Misjudgment of a child’s abilities
* Increased stress for children and parents
* Early labeling of children
