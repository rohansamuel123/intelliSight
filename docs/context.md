# 🧠 IntelliSight — Full Project Context (AI-Ready)

---

## 📌 Project Identity

**Name:** IntelliSight
**Type:** AI-powered cognitive assessment platform for children
**Platform:** Mobile-first (React Native)
**Goal:** Replace rigid IQ-based evaluation with **behavior-based cognitive assessment**

---

## 🎯 Core Idea (VERY IMPORTANT)

Instead of testing children with static IQ questions:

👉 We observe **how they interact with tasks**

We measure:

- Memory
- Attention
- Logic
- Comprehension
- Processing Speed

👉 Then use AI to interpret these behaviors into a **cognitive profile**

---

## 🧠 Key Principle

> “Measure thinking patterns, not just answers.”

### Frontend Structure (Expo Router)

The frontend is built using a file-based routing system where each file in `app/` is a screen.

```bash
frontend/

```

#### 🧩 Frontend File Responsibilities:
- **`app/index.tsx`**: The main entry point. Checks for persistent login session. If logged in, redirects to `/dashboard`. If not, displays "Quick Login" avatars and manual email/password login.
- **`app/profile.tsx`**: Parent account creation (Name, Email, Password). Stores locally via `AsyncStorage`, logs in immediately.
- **`app/dashboard.tsx`**: The main hub. Shows overall score ring, 5 domain progress bars (Memory, Attention, Logic, Speed, Comprehension), game stats (total games, stars, unlocked count), and a vertical **Journey Map** of all 8 games with progressive unlocking.
- **`app/game-results.tsx`**: Post-game screen showing 1-3 star rating, score ring in domain color, game info badge, and "Play Again" / "Next Game" navigation.
- **`app/cognitive-profile.tsx`**: Full cognitive profile with radar visualization, domain breakdown with mini score rings, session history, and AI analysis placeholder.
- **`app/games/*.tsx`**: Each game follows the same pattern: intro screen → 3 progressive difficulty rounds (Easy → Medium → Hard) → auto-save results to AsyncStorage → navigate to game-results.
- **`data/gameRegistry.ts`**: Single source of truth for all game metadata (id, name, emoji, domain, route, color, instructions).
- **`utils/scoring.ts`**: Normalizes raw metrics (accuracy, time, level) to 0-100. Aggregates per-domain scores. Calculates overall cognitive score. Manages progressive unlocking (complete a game → unlock the next). Stores/retrieves session history from AsyncStorage.
- **`components/Button.tsx`**: Reusable 3D pill-shaped `<Pressable>` button (primary, secondary, outline variants).

## 🔄 System Flow (End-to-End)

### 1. Account & Session Flow
- **App Launch:** `index.tsx` checks `AsyncStorage` for `currentUser`. 
- **If authenticated:** Immediately route to `dashboard.tsx`.
- **If unauthenticated:**
  - Display "Quick Access" profiles (loaded from `accounts` array in `AsyncStorage`).
  - User taps Quick Access -> logs in instantly.
  - OR User logs in manually with Email/Password.
  - OR User taps "Create Profile" -> navigates to `profile.tsx` -> saves new account to `AsyncStorage` -> logs in.

### 2. Dashboard & Journey Map
- Dashboard shows overall cognitive score ring, domain progress bars, and game stats.
- **Journey Map:** A vertical scrollable list of 8 games. Game 1 is always unlocked. Each completed game unlocks the next.
- Child taps an unlocked game card → navigates to that game's intro screen.

### 3. Gameplay Interaction (✅ Implemented)
- Each game has an **intro screen** with instructions.
- Game plays through **3 progressive rounds** (Easy → Medium → Hard).
- During play, the app captures: accuracy, time taken, level reached, correct/incorrect responses.
- On completion, a `GameSession` object is saved to `AsyncStorage`:
```json
{
  "gameId": "color-recall",
  "domain": "memory",
  "score": 5,
  "maxScore": 7,
  "accuracy": 71,
  "timeTaken": 45.2,
  "level": 3,
  "stars": 2,
  "playedAt": "2026-05-07T01:30:00.000Z"
}
```

### 4. Results & Stars
- After each game → `game-results.tsx` shows stars (1-3), score ring, domain info.
- "Play Again" or "Next Game" navigation.

### 5. Cognitive Scoring (✅ Frontend Implemented)
- Raw metrics are **normalized to 0-100** using weighted formula: 50% accuracy + 30% level + 20% speed.
- **Per-domain scores:** Best score per game, averaged across games in that domain.
- **Overall score:** Average across all scored domains.
- **Stars:** ≥80 = ⭐⭐⭐, ≥50 = ⭐⭐, else ⭐

### 6. Cognitive Profile
- `cognitive-profile.tsx` shows domain bar chart, overall score, session history.
- AI Analysis button (placeholder — ready for backend integration).

### 7. Backend Processing (Planned)
- Frontend will POST session data to backend.
- Backend stores raw session in DB, computes aggregate metrics.

### 8. AI Processing (Planned)
Input: aggregated scores + gameplay history
Output: strengths, weaknesses, recommendations, readiness level

### 🚧 In Progress

- API structuring
- Backend endpoints for receiving game sessions from frontend
- Connecting frontend local accounts with backend Postgres accounts

### ❌ Not Started

- Frontend → Backend session sync (POST game sessions to API)
- AI integration (passing cognitive profiles to AI for analysis)
- Backend score computation algorithms
- AI report display on frontend

---

## ⚠️ Networking Setup (IMPORTANT)

- Use Expo Tunnel OR same WiFi
- Backend must run with:
  ```bash
  uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
  ```
- Frontend API base URL is configured via `.env` file:
  ```
  EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:8000
  ```
- `api.js` reads this env var: `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL`
- `.env` is in `.gitignore`, `.env.example` is committed for reference

---

## 🧠 AI Integration Plan

### Role of AI
- NOT real-time gameplay
- ONLY post-analysis

### Input to AI
- Cognitive scores
- Session history

### Output
Structured JSON:
```json
{
  "strengths": "...",
  "weaknesses": "...",
  "recommendations": "...",
  "readiness_level": "..."
}
```

## 🧩 Game Design Approach

### Design Principles
- Simple, visual, and fun for children
- Minimal reading required
- Capture **interaction patterns**, not just right/wrong answers
- Each game has **3 progressive difficulty rounds** (Easy → Medium → Hard)
- Games **unlock sequentially** to guide the child through the assessment

### 8 Implemented Games (Research-Backed)

| # | Game | Domain | Inspired By | Measures |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 🎨 Color Recall | Memory | Corsi Block-Tapping | Visual-spatial working memory |
| 2 | ⚡ Speed Tap | Processing Speed | Simple Reaction Time | Motor speed, visual-motor coordination |
| 3 | 🎈 Balloon Pop | Attention | Go/No-Go Task | Sustained attention, impulse control |
| 4 | 🃏 Card Match | Memory | Concentration/Pairs | Recognition memory, short-term recall |
| 5 | 🔍 Odd One Out | Attention | Visual Search | Selective attention, visual scanning |
| 6 | 🧩 Pattern Puzzle | Logic | Raven's Matrices | Pattern recognition, logical reasoning |
| 7 | 🔢 Sequence Builder | Logic | Series Completion | Sequential logic, rule inference |
| 8 | 📋 Follow Steps | Comprehension | Token Test | Instruction following, verbal comprehension |

### Scoring Formula
- **Normalized Score (0-100):** `accuracy × 0.5 + (level/maxLevel × 100) × 0.3 + speedBonus × 0.2`
- **Star Rating:** ≥80 = 3 stars, ≥50 = 2 stars, else 1 star
- **Domain Score:** Average of best scores across games in that domain
- **Overall Score:** Average across all scored domains

---

## 🎯 Design Constraints

- UI must be child-friendly (warm colors, playful 3D buttons, large touch targets)
- Backend must remain simple
- AI should enhance, not complicate
- Avoid over-engineering
