# 🧠 IntelliSight — Full Project Context (AI-Ready)

---

## 📌 Project Identity

**Name:** IntelliSight
**Type:** AI-powered cognitive assessment platform for children
**Platform:** Mobile-first (React Native)
**Goal:** Replace rigid IQ-based evaluation with **behavior-based cognitive assessment**

---

## 🎯 Core Idea (VERY IMPORTANT)

Instead of testing children with static IQ questions:

👉 We observe **how they interact with tasks**

We measure:

- Memory
- Attention
- Logic
- Comprehension
- Processing Speed

👉 Then use AI to interpret these behaviors into a **cognitive profile**

---

## 🧠 Key Principle

> “Measure thinking patterns, not just answers.”

### Frontend Structure (Expo Router)

The frontend is built using a file-based routing system where each file in `app/` is a screen.

```bash
frontend/
├── app/
│   ├── _layout.tsx         # Root layout configuration (controls header visibility)
│   ├── index.tsx           # Home/Login screen (Quick Access & Manual Login)
│   ├── profile.tsx         # Parent account creation
│   ├── dashboard.tsx       # Landing page after successful login
│   ├── game.tsx            # (Planned) Game screen
│   ├── report.tsx          # (Planned) AI report
│
├── components/             # Reusable UI
│   └── Button.tsx          # Custom 3D gamified button component
│
├── assets/                 # Images, fonts, etc.
│   └── mascot.png          # Mascot image
│
├── services/               # API connection logic
│   └── api.js              # Axios config

├── constants/              # Config values
```

#### 🧩 Frontend File Responsibilities:

- **`app/index.tsx`**: The main entry point. It checks for a persistent login session on mount. If logged in, redirects to `/dashboard`. If not, it reads saved profiles from `AsyncStorage` and displays large "Quick Login" avatars. It also handles manual email/password login.
- **`app/profile.tsx`**: Allows users to create a parent account (Name, Email, Password). Upon creation, the account is stored locally via `AsyncStorage` inside an `accounts` array, and the user is instantly logged in (saving to `currentUser` key) and routed to `/dashboard`.
- **`app/dashboard.tsx`**: The landing screen for parents. It reads the `currentUser` from `AsyncStorage` to display a personalized greeting. Includes a "Logout" mechanism that clears the session and routes back to `/`.
- **`components/Button.tsx`**: A reusable, highly stylized React Native `<Pressable>` component that gives buttons a tactile, 3D pill-shaped feel suitable for a gamified, child-friendly app.

### Backend Structure

```bash
backend/
├── app/
│   ├── main.py             # Entry point (FastAPI server)
│   ├── routes/
│   │   ├── user.py
│   │   ├── game.py
│   │   ├── session.py
│   │   ├── report.py

│   │   ├── ai_service.py
│   │
│   ├── db/
│   │   └── database.py     # Database connection setup
```

## 🔄 System Flow (End-to-End)

### 1. Account & Session Flow

- **App Launch:** `index.tsx` checks `AsyncStorage` for `currentUser`.
- **If authenticated:** Immediately route to `dashboard.tsx`.
- **If unauthenticated:**
  - Display "Quick Access" profiles (loaded from `accounts` array in `AsyncStorage`).
  - User taps Quick Access -> logs in instantly.
  - OR User logs in manually with Email/Password.
  - OR User taps "Create Profile" -> navigates to `profile.tsx` -> saves new account to `AsyncStorage` -> logs in.

### 2. Gameplay Interaction (Planned)

- Child plays game in mobile app

### 3. Data Capture (Planned)

Frontend sends:

```json
{
  "user_id": "uuid",
  "game_id": "memory_01",
  "actions": [...],
  "time_taken": 12.5,
  "accuracy": 80
}
```

### 4. Backend Processing

- Store raw session in DB
- Compute basic metrics

### 5. Cognitive Scoring

Derived metrics:

- memory_score
- attention_score
- logic_score
- comprehension_score
- processing_speed

### 6. AI Processing (OpenClaw)

Input:

- aggregated scores
- gameplay history
  Output:
- strengths, weaknesses, recommendations, readiness level

### 7. Output

- Dashboard updated
- Report displayed

## 🔌 API Design (Planned)

### Auth & User (Parent)

- POST /users/login → authenticate and receive JWT
- GET /users/me → get current authenticated parent profile
- GET /users → list all parents (admin)

### Children

- POST /children → add a child profile to the authenticated parent
- GET /children → list all children for the authenticated parent
- GET /children/{id} → get specific child
- PUT /children/{id} → update child profile
- DELETE /children/{id} → remove child profile

### Game

- GET /games → fetch available games

### Session

- POST /session → submit gameplay

### Report

- GET /report/{user_id} → fetch AI report

### ❌ Not Started

- Game logic
- AI integration
- Backend score computation algorithms

---

## ⚠️ Networking Setup (IMPORTANT)

- Use Expo Tunnel OR same WiFi
- Backend must run with:
  ```bash
  uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
  ```
- API baseURL:
  - localhost for web
  - IPv4 for mobile

---

## 🧠 AI Integration Plan

### Role of AI

- NOT real-time gameplay
- ONLY post-analysis

### Input to AI

- Cognitive scores
- Session history

### Output

Structured JSON:

```json
{
  "strengths": "...",
  "weaknesses": "...",
  "recommendations": "...",
  "readiness_level": "..."
}
```

## 🧩 Game Design Approach

Games should:

- Be simple and visual
- Require minimal reading
- Capture interaction patterns

Examples:

- Memory sequence
- Pattern matching
- Follow instructions

---

## 🎯 Design Constraints

- UI must be child-friendly (warm colors, playful 3D buttons, large touch targets)
- Backend must remain simple
- AI should enhance, not complicate
- Avoid over-engineering

---

## 🧾 Usage for AI Tools

## 🚀 Final Vision

Create a platform where:

> “Every child is understood based on how they think, not judged by a single number.”
